# Facial-Emotion-Detection
This project uses ResNet50, a pretrained CNN model for image classification, to detect facial expressions in images. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify the emotions displayed in a given image. The model is trained on the dataset for analyzing the sentiments.

## Dataset Used:
The dataset used for this project is:
[Face expression recognition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset).

There are 7 different kind of emotions in the dataset.

## Technologies used:
- tensorflow
- torch
- keras
- ResNet50

## Usage Instructions:
To use the trained model on the dataset, extract the `model.zip/model/resnet_model.zip/resnet.pth` and then adjust the path in the notebook for the model and use it to predict the labels.
